# Cooperative Training at Smart Methods

This repository contains the projects I worked on during my cooperative training at **Smart Methods**. Throughout the training, I gained hands-on experience in various technical fields, including **DevOps**, **Linux system administration**, **robotics**, and **machine learning**. Below is an overview of the key projects and skills I developed.

## Key Projects

1. **System Development with Linux & DevOps**
   - Implemented system management strategies and automation using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
   - Gained proficiency in using Linux for server administration and process optimization.

2. **Robotics Design and Programming (Arduino & ROS)**
   - Developed robotic systems using Arduino for controlling robotic arms and implementing movement algorithms.
   - Worked on ROS1 and ROS2 projects, including:
     - **Turtlesim simulation** for learning ROS basics.
     - **MoveIt! integration** to control robotic arms with precision.
     
3. **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
   - Participated in AI-driven projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.
   - Applied machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems, including:
     - Linear regression models for predictive analytics.
     - Decision trees for classification tasks.
